Date Time: Jul 8, 2020 09:00 AM Hong Kong SAR

Last July 8, I attended a virtual talk about how start-up founders are spearheading and pushing the limits in the brainstorming of creative ways for efficient and effective collaboration. The talk revolved around how mentorship engagement is an essential factor of innovation. I thought of taking notes and posting it here ‘cause #sharingiscaring.

    * Ask for 5 minutes instead of one hour!
        * You will always get a yes
    * Be careful, ask for something soft
        * Instead of asking for funding, ask “I’m thinking of starting up this business., do you think it’s a good idea?”
* Mentorship is a two-way relationship (Fritz)
    * Right before lunch is the perfect time
    * Don’t ask for a coffee on a Sunday night (have manners!)
    * Ask questions that are not answerable by Google
    * Don’t get intimidated by accomplished people
* It only takes one mentor to change you
* Virtual mentorship
    * Make up for the things you’re missing like non-verbal comms (body language)
* Dealing with mental health
    * People tend to share more on the phone
    * Weekly, at the same time, reflect about yourself
    * Being open and honest to yourself is the first step
        * Journaling every single night
* How will you persuade your mentors your idea is right?
    * Question is wrong
    * You must have a self-awareness
    * No need to persuade your mentor, you must have an intention for the business
    * Do it the best way you can and not because you’re persuading someone
    * It’s a compliment when people do not believe in your idea
        * Don’t worry about it too much
