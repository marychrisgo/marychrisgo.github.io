Hello. I'm Mc. A full-time procrastinator who attempts to do science. I have a wide spectrum of music taste. I have a playlist with Salbakuta's Stupid Love and Rimsky-Korsakov's Fight of the Bumblebee in it. If you see me, you can tell I am the **epitome of Asian beauty** aka my face is very common in Asia.  

Welcome to my personal website! I made this to pretty much dump everything I do. I love keeping memories. But during the quarantine, I decided to try minimalism. Well, not total minimalism… but maybe let’s call it “attempted to try minimalism”. I purged most of my stuff like airplane tickets, cinema tickets, undergraduate notes I kept for how many years. It took a lot of *courage* throwing them all away, trust me. I had three extra-large trash bags for all of them, *lol*. 

After a long period of reflection, I thought that I can be a minimalist and sentimental person at the same time. Thanks to the digital world. I took some pictures of my undergraduate notes before throwing them. I put everything in my hard drive which I guess is enough. Also, it’s more convenient to carry them around since I won’t be settling in one country. My life for the next two years requires me to travel every six months to another country! I guess portability and accessibility are my top priorities for now. 

Anyway, that’s just the main reason why this website was built. I guess… that’s all I have to say.
