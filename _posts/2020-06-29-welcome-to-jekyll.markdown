Hello. I'm Mc. A full-time procrastinator who attempts to do science. I have a wide spectrum of music taste. I have a playlist with Salbakuta's Stupid Love and Rimsky-Korsakov's Fight of the Bumblebee in it. If you see me, you can tell I am the **epitome of Asian beauty** aka my face is very common in Asia.  

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
